# List Comprehensions:
#
#	List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists in Python.
#	They are a way to apply an operation to each item in a sequence (like a list) 
#	and collect the results into a new list.
    

# Example of list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]


#############################################################################################
# Object-Oriented Programming - OOP:
#
#	Python supports object-oriented programming, which allows you to create 
#	classes and objects, encapsulate data, and define methods to operate on that data.



# Example of defining a class
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        print(self.name + " says Woof!")

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
my_dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
Exception Handling: Python provides a robust way to handle errors and exceptions using try, except, finally, and raise statements.

python
Copy code
# Example of exception handling
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
Modules and Packages: Python modules are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python scripts. Packages are namespaces that contain multiple modules. You can create your own modules and packages or use existing ones from the Python Standard Library or third-party libraries.

python
Copy code
# Example of importing modules
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
File I/O: Python provides built-in functions for reading from and writing to files on the disk.

python
Copy code
# Example of file I/O
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    data = file.read()
Virtual Environments: Virtual environments allow you to create isolated environments for Python projects, with their own dependencies and packages. This is useful for managing project dependencies and avoiding conflicts between different projects.

bash
Copy code
# Example of creating a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
Decorators: Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to modify the behavior of functions or methods. They are often used for logging, authentication, and performance monitoring.

python
Copy code
# Example of defining a decorator
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()  # Output: Something is happening before the function is called.
             #         Hello!
             #         Something is happening after the function is called.
These are just a few more concepts in Python to explore. As you delve deeper, you'll encounter many more interesting features and libraries that make Python such a versatile and powerful language.

############################################################################################# 
Generators and Iterators: Generators are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples, but they generate their values lazily. This means they generate values one at a time and only when needed, which can save memory and improve performance.

python
Copy code
# Example of a generator
def square_numbers(nums):
    for num in nums:
        yield num * num

my_nums = square_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(next(my_nums))  # Output: 1
print(next(my_nums))  # Output: 4
Concurrency and Parallelism: Python offers several libraries and modules for concurrent and parallel programming, such as asyncio for asynchronous programming, and multiprocessing and threading for parallel execution.

python
Copy code
# Example of asynchronous programming with asyncio
import asyncio

async def hello():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("World")

asyncio.run(hello())
Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming paradigms, including higher-order functions, lambda functions, and functions like map, filter, and reduce.

python
Copy code
# Example of using map and lambda function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)
print(list(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Regular Expressions (Regex): Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text processing. Python's re module provides support for working with regular expressions.

python
Copy code
# Example of using regular expressions
import re
pattern = r'\b(\w+)\s+\1\b'  # Match repeated words
text = "hello hello world"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['hello']
Closures and Scope: Python supports closures, which are functions that remember the values from the enclosing lexical scope even when the scope has finished executing.

python
Copy code
# Example of closure
def outer_function(message):
    def inner_function():
        print(message)
    return inner_function

my_func = outer_function("Hello")
my_func()  # Output: Hello
