I am a begginer at python myself, and I was finding it difficult to find free resources that gave me the basics of Python and a few learning assignments that let me build my skills form the ground up - so I fifured why not make one!

[If you want to have a look at some of the basic python concepts, have a look here.]()<br>
<br>
Here are some starting exercises, each one has the assignment details and skills/knowledge you'll need inside!<br>
<br>
I would recommed downloading the full repository and opening everything in Visual Studio Code - you can do this by cloning https://github.com/knbyte/Learning-Python.git or downloading using the </> Code button above!<br>
<br>
Otherwise, if you want to see each assignment individually on github the links are below!:<br>
