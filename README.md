Beginner Python Assignments
1. Hello, World!
Write a Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. Calculator
Create a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers. Ask the user to input the numbers and the operation they want to perform.

3. Guess the Number
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback to the user if their guess is too high or too low until they guess the correct number.

4. Temperature Converter
Write a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. Ask the user for the temperature and the unit (Fahrenheit or Celsius), and then convert it to the other unit.

5. Factorial Calculator
Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

6. Palindrome Checker
Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

7. Fibonacci Sequence
Write a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms.

8. Simple To-Do List
Create a simple to-do list program that allows the user to add tasks, remove tasks, and view the list of tasks.

9. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Write a program that allows the user to play the game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer. Randomly generate the computer's choice and determine the winner based on the game's rules.

10. Word Counter
Write a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the number of words in it. Display the result to the user.

To complete the above assignments, you'll need a basic understanding of Python programming concepts such as:

Variables and Data Types: Knowing how to work with integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
Control Structures: Understanding if statements, loops (for and while), and how to control the flow of your program.
Functions: Creating and calling functions to modularize your code.
Input and Output: Using input() function to get user input and print() function to display output.
Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
String manipulation: Concatenating strings, slicing, and formatting.
Random number generation: Using the random module to generate random numbers.
Handling errors: Basic knowledge of handling exceptions using try-except blocks.
Libraries: Familiarity with built-in Python libraries like math for mathematical operations.
File I/O: Basic understanding of reading from and writing to files using Python.
Most of these assignments are designed to reinforce these fundamental concepts while also providing practical problem-solving experience. As you work through them, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Python programming and its various capabilities. If you're new to Python, you may want to start with simpler assignments and gradually move on to more complex ones as you become more comfortable with the language.
