# Learning Python!

I am a beginner at python myself, and I was finding it difficult to find free resources that gave me the basics of Python and a few learning assignments that let me build my skills from the ground up - so I figured why not make one!

### Concepts
[Basic Python Conepts](https://github.com/knbyte/Learning-Python/blob/main/Concepts/Basic.py).<br>
[Further Python Concepts](https://github.com/knbyte/Learning-Python/blob/main/Concepts/Further-Concepts-One.py).<br>
[Even More Python Concepts](https://github.com/knbyte/Learning-Python/blob/main/Concepts/Further-Concepts-Two.py).<br>
<br>
### Exercises/Practice!
Here are some starting exercises, each one has the assignment details and skills/knowledge you'll need inside!<br>
<br>
I would recommend downloading the full repository and opening everything in Visual Studio Code - you can do this by running ```git clone https://github.com/knbyte/Learning-Python.git``` in your terminal or downloading using the </> Code button above!<br>
