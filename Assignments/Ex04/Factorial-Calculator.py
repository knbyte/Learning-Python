5. Factorial Calculator
Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.



To complete the "Factorial Calculator" assignment, you'll need to understand recursion or iteration (depending on your preferred approach) and how to implement factorial calculations. Here's what you'll need:

Understanding of Factorial: Factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Recursion or Iteration: You can calculate factorial using either recursion or iteration. Recursion involves a function calling itself, while iteration involves looping through a range of numbers. You'll need to understand one of these approaches.

Control Structures: If you choose the iterative approach, you'll use loops (such as for loops) to iterate through the numbers and calculate the factorial. If you choose the recursive approach, you'll use control structures to handle the recursion.

Here's a basic outline of what you'll need to do:

Prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer for which they want to calculate the factorial.
Implement a function to calculate the factorial using either recursion or iteration.
Display the result to the user.

#	- Random Number Generation:                                                             #
#		You'll need to generate a random number within a specified range                    #
#		(e.g., between 1 and 100). Python provides the random module, which includes        #
#		functions for generating random numbers.                                            #
#                                                                                           #
# 	- User Input:                                                                           #
#		You'll use the input() function to get input from the user. The user will           #
#		guess the number, and your program will provide feedback based on their guess.      #
#                                                                                           #

#		You'll use control structures like if statements and loops to control the           #
#		flow of the game. For example, you'll use if statements to compare the              #
#		user's guess with the randomly generated number and provide feedback.               #
#                                                                                           #

#		You'll need to loop the game until the user guesses the correct number.             #
#		You can use a while loop for this purpose.                                          #
#                                                                                           #

#		Compare the user's guess with the randomly generated number.                        #
#		Provide feedback (e.g., "Too high", "Too low", "Correct!").                         #
