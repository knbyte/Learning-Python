7. Fibonacci Sequence
Write a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms.



To complete the "Fibonacci Sequence" assignment, you'll need to understand recursion or iteration (depending on your preferred approach) and how to implement the Fibonacci sequence. Here's what you'll need:

Understanding of Fibonacci Sequence: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence typically starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

Recursion or Iteration: You can calculate Fibonacci numbers using either recursion or iteration. Recursion involves a function calling itself, while iteration involves looping through a range of numbers. You'll need to understand one of these approaches.

Control Structures: If you choose the iterative approach, you'll use loops (such as for loops) to iterate through the numbers and calculate the Fibonacci sequence. If you choose the recursive approach, you'll use control structures to handle the recursion.

Here's a basic outline of what you'll need to do:

Prompt the user to enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence they want to generate.
Implement a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence using either recursion or iteration.
Display the generated sequence to the user.

#		You'll need to generate a random number within a specified range                    #
#		(e.g., between 1 and 100). Python provides the random module, which includes        #
#		functions for generating random numbers.                                            #
#                                                                                           #
# 	- User Input:                                                                           #
#		You'll use the input() function to get input from the user. The user will           #
#		guess the number, and your program will provide feedback based on their guess.      #
#                                                                                           #

#		You'll use control structures like if statements and loops to control the           #
#		flow of the game. For example, you'll use if statements to compare the              #
#		user's guess with the randomly generated number and provide feedback.               #
#                                                                                           #

#		You'll need to loop the game until the user guesses the correct number.             #
#		You can use a while loop for this purpose.                                          #

#		Compare the user's guess with the randomly generated number.                        #
#		Provide feedback (e.g., "Too high", "Too low", "Correct!").                         #
