6. Palindrome Checker
Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.




To complete the "Palindrome Checker" assignment, you'll need to understand string manipulation, conditionals, and iteration. Here's what you'll need:

Understanding of Palindromes: A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). For example, "radar" and "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" are palindromes.

String Manipulation: You'll need to manipulate strings to remove spaces, punctuation, and convert characters to a consistent case (either lowercase or uppercase).

Iteration or Looping: You'll iterate through the characters of the string to compare characters from the beginning and end to determine if it's a palindrome.

Control Structures: You'll use control structures such as if statements to check if the given string is a palindrome or not.

Here's a basic outline of what you'll need to do:

Prompt the user to enter a string.
Remove spaces and punctuation from the string and convert it to lowercase or uppercase.
Check if the modified string is the same forward and backward to determine if it's a palindrome.
Display the result to the user.

#	To complete the "Guess the Number" assignment, you'll need to understand how to generate# 
#	random numbers, receive user input, and use control structures to manage the game flow. #
#                                                                                           #
#	- Random Number Generation:                                                             #
#		You'll need to generate a random number within a specified range                    #
#		(e.g., between 1 and 100). Python provides the random module, which includes        #
#		functions for generating random numbers.                                            #
#                                                                                           #
# 	- User Input:                                                                           #
#		You'll use the input() function to get input from the user. The user will           #
#		guess the number, and your program will provide feedback based on their guess.      #
#                                                                                           #
#	- Control Structures:                                                                   #
#		You'll use control structures like if statements and loops to control the           #
#		flow of the game. For example, you'll use if statements to compare the              #
#		user's guess with the randomly generated number and provide feedback.               #
#                                                                                           #

#		You'll need to loop the game until the user guesses the correct number.             #
#		You can use a while loop for this purpose.                                          #
#                                                                                           #

#		Prompt the user to guess the number.                                                #
#		Compare the user's guess with the randomly generated number.                        #
#		Provide feedback (e.g., "Too high", "Too low", "Correct!").                         #
