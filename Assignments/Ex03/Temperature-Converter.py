4. Temperature Converter
Write a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. Ask the user for the temperature and the unit (Fahrenheit or Celsius), and then convert it to the other unit.
	

	
To complete the "Temperature Converter" assignment, you'll need to understand basic arithmetic operations, user input, and string formatting. Here's what you'll need:

Arithmetic Operations: You'll need to know how to perform mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

User Input: You'll use the input() function to get input from the user. The user will input the temperature value and the unit (Fahrenheit or Celsius) they want to convert.

Control Structures: You'll use control structures like if statements to determine the conversion formula based on the user's input.

String Formatting: You'll format the output message to display the converted temperature value.

Here's a basic outline of what you'll need to do:

Prompt the user to enter the temperature value and the unit (Fahrenheit or Celsius).
Based on the unit provided by the user, convert the temperature to the other unit.
Display the converted temperature value to the user.

#	Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and asks the user     #

#	To complete the "Guess the Number" assignment, you'll need to understand how to generate# 
#	random numbers, receive user input, and use control structures to manage the game flow. #                                                                               #
#                                                                                           #
#	- Random Number Generation:                                                             #
#		You'll need to generate a random number within a specified range                    #
#		(e.g., between 1 and 100). Python provides the random module, which includes        #
#		functions for generating random numbers.                                            #
#                                                                                           #
# 	- User Input:                                                                           #
#		You'll use the input() function to get input from the user. The user will           #
#		guess the number, and your program will provide feedback based on their guess.      #
#                                                                                           #

#		You'll use control structures like if statements and loops to control the           #
#		flow of the game. For example, you'll use if statements to compare the              #
#		user's guess with the randomly generated number and provide feedback.               #
#                                                                                           #

#		You'll need to loop the game until the user guesses the correct number.             #
#		You can use a while loop for this purpose.                                          #
#                                                                                           #
#	- Basic Outline:                                                                        #

#		Generate a random number within a specified range.                                  #
#		Prompt the user to guess the number.                                                #
#		Compare the user's guess with the randomly generated number.                        #
#		Provide feedback (e.g., "Too high", "Too low", "Correct!").                         #
#		Continue prompting the user until they guess the correct number.                    #
