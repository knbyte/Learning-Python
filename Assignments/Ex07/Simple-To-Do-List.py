8. Simple To-Do List
Create a simple to-do list program that allows the user to add tasks, remove tasks, and view the list of tasks.


To complete the "Simple To-Do List" assignment, you'll need to understand basic data structures (such as lists), user input, and control structures. Here's what you'll need:

Lists: You'll use a list to store the tasks in the to-do list. Lists in Python are mutable sequences, allowing you to add, remove, or modify elements.

User Input: You'll use the input() function to get input from the user. The user will input commands to add tasks, remove tasks, or view the list of tasks.

Control Structures: You'll use control structures such as if statements to determine which action to perform based on the user's input.

Here's a basic outline of what you'll need to do:

Create an empty list to store tasks.
Prompt the user to input commands to add tasks, remove tasks, or view the list of tasks.
Implement logic to add tasks to the list, remove tasks from the list, or display the list of tasks based on the user's input.

#	Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and asks the user     #

#	To complete the "Guess the Number" assignment, you'll need to understand how to generate# 
#	random numbers, receive user input, and use control structures to manage the game flow. #
#                                                                                           #
#	- Random Number Generation:                                                             #
#		You'll need to generate a random number within a specified range                    #
#		(e.g., between 1 and 100). Python provides the random module, which includes        #
#		functions for generating random numbers.                                            #
#                                                                                           #
# 	- User Input:                                                                           #
#		You'll use the input() function to get input from the user. The user will           #
#		guess the number, and your program will provide feedback based on their guess.      #
#                                                                                           #

#		You'll use control structures like if statements and loops to control the           #
#		flow of the game. For example, you'll use if statements to compare the              #
#		user's guess with the randomly generated number and provide feedback.               #
#                                                                                           #

#		You'll need to loop the game until the user guesses the correct number.             #
#		You can use a while loop for this purpose.                                          #
#                                                                                           #

#		Prompt the user to guess the number.                                                #
#		Compare the user's guess with the randomly generated number.                        #
#		Provide feedback (e.g., "Too high", "Too low", "Correct!").                         #
