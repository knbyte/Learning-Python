9. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Write a program that allows the user to play the game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer. Randomly generate the computer's choice and determine the winner based on the game's rules.


To complete the "Rock, Paper, Scissors Game" assignment, you'll need to understand user input, random number generation, and control structures. Here's what you'll need:

User Input: You'll use the input() function to get input from the user. The user will input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for the game.

Random Number Generation: You'll use the random module to generate the computer's choice (rock, paper, or scissors). This will simulate the computer's move in the game.

Control Structures: You'll use control structures such as if statements to determine the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.

Here's a basic outline of what you'll need to do:

Prompt the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
Generate the computer's choice randomly.
Determine the winner based on the user's and computer's choices.
Display the result of the game to the user.

#	To complete the "Guess the Number" assignment, you'll need to understand how to generate# 
#	random numbers, receive user input, and use control structures to manage the game flow. #
#                                                                                           #
#	- Random Number Generation:                                                             #
#		You'll need to generate a random number within a specified range                    #
#		(e.g., between 1 and 100). Python provides the random module, which includes        #
#		functions for generating random numbers.                                            #
#                                                                                           #
# 	- User Input:                                                                           #
#		You'll use the input() function to get input from the user. The user will           #
#		guess the number, and your program will provide feedback based on their guess.      #
#                                                                                           #
#	- Control Structures:                                                                   #
#		You'll use control structures like if statements and loops to control the           #
#		flow of the game. For example, you'll use if statements to compare the              #
#		user's guess with the randomly generated number and provide feedback.               #
#                                                                                           #

#		You'll need to loop the game until the user guesses the correct number.             #
#		You can use a while loop for this purpose.                                          #
#                                                                                           #

#		Generate a random number within a specified range.                                  #
#		Prompt the user to guess the number.                                                #
#		Compare the user's guess with the randomly generated number.                        #
#		Provide feedback (e.g., "Too high", "Too low", "Correct!").                         #
#		Continue prompting the user until they guess the correct number.                    #
